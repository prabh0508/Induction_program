### The induction program at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) marked the beginning of an important new chapter in my academic life. The experience was a mix of emotions, excitement, curiosity, and nervousness—as I stepped into this new environment. The program was thoughtfully planned to introduce us to the institution’s values, academics, and faculty, helping ease our transition into college life.Our day began with a visit to the Gurudwara Sahib on campus. We took part in a peaceful paath (prayer), which created a calm and spiritually uplifting start to the day. I found this moment especially grounding. It helped reduce my nervousness and reminded me of the deeper purpose of education. It was comforting to see the college’s commitment to its cultural and spiritual roots. Following the prayer, we had a tea break with refreshments. While it was a nice gesture, the arrangements felt a bit chaotic. There was noticeable disorganisation, which caused some confusion and delay. This part of the event felt a little frustrating, but I understood it could have been due to the large crowd. We then proceeded to the auditorium where the main orientation began. Dr. Sehajpal, the Principal of GNDEC, welcomed us and introduced us to the curriculum. His words were informative and gave me a better sense of what to expect academically. I felt a sense of clarity and purpose after hearing about the structure and support systems available to us. Next, Prof. Harpreet Kaur, Head of the Applied Science Department, spoke to us about the foundation courses and the role of applied sciences in engineering. Her address reassured me, and I began to feel more confident about tackling the first year of college. The session continued with an inspiring talk by S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, ex-Cabinet Minister and a trustee of the Nankana Sahib Trust, which funds the university. His speech had a motivational tone that left a deep impact on me. He spoke about the value of education, discipline, and giving back to society. Listening to him made me feel proud to be part of an institution with such strong values and backing. Afterward, we had a lunch break, which was followed by a guided tour of the Mechanical Engineering Department. We were introduced to the departmental facilities and met several faculty members. Seeing the labs and interacting with the professors made everything feel more real, and I started to picture myself learning and growing in that very space. The tour sparked a sense of excitement for the hands-on learning experiences to come.
